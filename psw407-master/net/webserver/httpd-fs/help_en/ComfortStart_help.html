<b>Comfort Start</b> - A safe start of the camera. 
The most problematic moment in camera operations is its start at low temperature. 
To ensure comfortable conditions for starting a camera in the cold season it is recommended to power on 
the heater of the thermal housing and only then turn on the camcorder. 
Checked box enables 1 or 2 hours delay between powering on the switch and turning on PoE for the camera. 

<br><br>
<b>Soft start time</b> - select the preheating duration. If the air temperature does not fall below minus 30Â°C, 
it is recommended to set the preheating to 1 hour, for lower temperatures, it is recommended to set it to 2 hours. 
<br><br>
<b>PoE status</b> - powering the camera by PoE. 
<br><br>
<b>Manual start</b> - forced start of the camera.
