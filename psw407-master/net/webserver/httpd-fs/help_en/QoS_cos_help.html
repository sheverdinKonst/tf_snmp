<b><p align="center"> Class of Service</p></b>
<br><br>
The Class of Service (CoS) field is 3 bits in the 802.1Q tag of the Ehernet frame. 
It allows to divide traffic into 8 priorities with different markings at the link level. 
The switch supports 4 queues of service: Queue 0 â€“ Queue 3. Queue 3 is the queue with the highest priority, 
Queue 0 is the queue with the lowest priority. 
The setting will apply, if you set the value of CoS State to <b>Enable</b> in the QoS General Settings tab. 
<br><br>
By default, the priorities are sorted by queue as follows:<br>
Priority 0 belongs to Queue 1<br>
Priority 1 belongs to Queue 0<br>
Priority 2 belongs to Queue 0<br>
Priority 3 belongs to Queue 1<br>
Priority 4 belongs to Queue 2<br>
Priority 5 belongs to Queue 2<br>
Priority 6 belongs to Queue 3<br> 
Priority 7 belongs to Queue 3<br>
