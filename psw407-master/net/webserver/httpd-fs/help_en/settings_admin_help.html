<b><p align="center"> User Accounts Settings</p></b>
<br><br>
This section contains the settings of user accounts.  
<br>All users can be divided into 2 groups:
<li><b>Admin</b> - users with administrator rights have unlimited authorities. 
<li><b>User</b> - restricted users. They do not have access to the settings, 
but they can reboot the cameras, see statistics, use VCT and Ping utilities. 
<br>
<br>By default, the switch has one administrator account with an unregistered login and password, 
so full access to the settings is possible without authentication. 
To restrict access you must specify a login and password for the user with <b>Admin</b> rights. 
And, if necessary, you should create one or more users with <b>User</b> rights. 
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>User Name</b> - Current user name 
<li><b>New User Name</b> - New user name 
<li><b>New Password</b> - New Password 
<li><b>Password Confirm</b> - Password confirmation 
<li><b>Access Right</b> - access rights: <b>Admin</b> or <b>User</b>.
</ul>
<br>  
<b>Note 1:</b> These fields are mandatory. The maximum length is 20 characters. Input language is English.<br><br>
<b>Note 2:</b> The fields are case sensitive.<br>
<b>Note 3:</b> Up to 4 users are supported.
