<b><p align="center"> MAC Address Filtering</p></b>
<br> 
<b>Ports Settings</b> - Port State. To enable filtering by MAC addresses, it is necessary to transfer to the <b>Secure</b> state. 
For normal operation, it is necessary to transfer to <b>Normal</b> state.<br><br>
There are several filtering options: 
<li><b>Secure: MAC filtration</b> - only MAC address filtering; only allowed addresses pass through, the rest are blocked. 
<li><b>Secure: Port shutdown</b> - MAC address filtering, if unallowed MAC address is detected on the port, the port is turned off. 
<li><b>Secure: Temporary port shutdown</b> - MAC address filtering, if an unallowed MAC address is detected on the port, 
the port is turned off for 5 minutes. If MAC is lost, the port is turned on; if not, the port remains off. 
<br><br>
<b>Add New MAC Address</b> - add a new allowed MAC address. 
<br><br>
<b>MAC Address Table</b> - table of added allowed MAC addresses. 
<br><br>
<b>Note 1:</b> in total, up to 50 entries of allowed MAC addresses are supported on all ports.
