<b><p align="center"> Port Settings</p></b>
<br> 
<ul>
<li><b>State</b> - port state. 
<li><b>Speed/Duplex</b> - Speed/Duplex 
<li><b>Flow Control</b> - control of data flow. Flow Control is active with Speed/Duplex = Auto 
<li><b>PoE</b> - Power over Ethernet. There are several options for power supply:<br>
<ul><li><b>Disabled</b> - PoE is disabled on this port. 
<li><b>Auto</b> - Main mode, power is transmitted by option A or B, or A and B upon the request of the powered equipment. 
<li><b>UltraPoE</b> - Power over A and B simultaneously. Adaptation for connection of Beward dome cameras. 
<li><b>Only A</b> -  Power is transmitted only by option A. 
<li><b>Only Ð’</b> - Power is transmitted only by option B. 
<li><b>Passive B</b> - Power is transmitted by option A in the protocol mode and by option B in the non-protocol mode. 
Mode for operation with TFortis TH-02 and TFortis TH-03 camera housings. 
<li><b>Forced A+B</b> - Power is transmitted by option A and B in the non-protocol mode. Connection of non-PoE devices is prohibited. 
</ul>
<li><b>SFP Link Mode</b> - the operating mode of SFP port. 
<ul><li><b>Forced</b> - forcing the link to come up when an optical signal is detected (Default mode) 
<li><b>Auto</b> - automatic mode 
</ul>
</ul>
<br><br><b>Note 1</b>: For PoE option B, it is possible to set the Passive PoE mode. 
This mode is required for connecting TH-02 and TH-03 camera housings. It should be noted that in this mode, the voltage (55 V) 
is applied to the Fast Ethernet port, so connecting devices that do not support PoE (for example, a computer) can cause them to fail. 
If you need a local connection to the Fast Ethernet ports of the PSW-2G+ switch, you must use a 4-wire (2-pair) 
patch cord or connect through Gigabit Ethernet ports.
