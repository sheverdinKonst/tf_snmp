<br>
The switches have digital inputs (dry contacts). The switches have 2 digital inputs. 
Also, when connecting the expansion board, you can use additional inputs. 
<br> 
<br>
<b>Inputs setting: :</b>
<li><b>State</b> - enables input operation. An alarm message will be sent, if State is in the Enable state, 
and Current State matches Alarm State and a tick is set in Inputs/Outputs in the Events List tab. 
<br>
<li><b>Alarm State</b> - the state of the input, which is considered to be alarm (<b>Open</b> - open state, <b>Short</b> - closed state). 

<li><b>Current State </b> - current state of the input. 
<br><br>
Outputs settings:
<li><b>Inital State</b> - initial state of the output. After the power is turned on, the output will be in this state. 
If the output is configured as <b>Logic</b>, then it is in the state defined in the <b>Logic</b> table
<br><br>
<b>Logic</b><br>
It is possible to configure the simplest algorithms for controlling the output. 
For each input, you can set an event by which the input will go to the selected state: 
<li><b>Open</b> - relay outputs are open 
<li><b>Short</b> - relay outputs are closed
<li><b>Impulse</b> - relay outputs change their state to inverse for 10 seconds, then switch back to the initial state. 
<br>
<b>Event</b> field specifies one or more events that will trigger the port. 
The unification of events occurs according to the rule of logical "OR", which means the output will trigger when at least one condition occurs.
<br>If none of the conditions is satisfied, the output is in the inverse state.
