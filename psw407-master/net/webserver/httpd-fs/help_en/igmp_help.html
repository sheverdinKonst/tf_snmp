<b><p align="center"> IGMP Snooping</p></b>
<br><br>
IGMP snooping is the process of monitoring IGMP network traffic that allows network layer devices (switches) 
to monitor IGMP traffic between consumers and multicast IP traffic providers (routers), 
formally occurring at a higher (network) level. This functionality always requires separate activation and configuration. 
<br>
<li><b>IGMP Snooping state</b> - state of IGMP protocol 
<li><b>Send IGMP Query</b> - Send General Query 
<li><b>Query Interval</b> - the interval between sending Query messages (1-255 seconds). 
<li><b>Query Response Interval</b> - the maximum time to wait for a response from the host to send periodic public queries (1-25 seconds). 
<li><b>Group Membership Interval</b> -  the interval while the router is waiting for an IGMP Report. If the report was not received, 
then the router believes that there are no more hosts on the network that belong to the group (1-255 seconds). 
<li><b>Other Querier Present Interval</b> - if the switch is Non-Querier, then if it has not received a Query during this interval, 
it starts to consider itself a Querier. 
 
 <li><b>Port State</b> - IGMP Snooping activity on the selected port. The checked box allows IGMP on the port, 
 unchecked box turns the port to normal operation.
