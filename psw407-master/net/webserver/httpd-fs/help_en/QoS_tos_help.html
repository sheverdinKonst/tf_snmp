<b><p align="center"> Type of Service</p></b>
<br><br>
Type of Service (ToS) â€“ field in the IP-header (1 byte). It is intended for marking traffic at the network level. 
The ToS field is filled with DSCP classifiers (6 bit), which can take the values 0-63. 
After the switch has accepted a packet containing the ToS field, it processes this packet in the corresponding queue. 
<br><br>
The setting will apply, if you set the value of CoS State to <b>Enable</b> in the QoS General Settings tab. 
<br><br> 
By default, the priorities are sorted by queue as follows:<br>
Priorities 0-7 belong to Queue 0<br>
Priorities 8-31 belong to Queue 1<br>
Priorities 32-55 belong to Queue 2<br>
Priorities 56-63 belong to Queue 3<br>
