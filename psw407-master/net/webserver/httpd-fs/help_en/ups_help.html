<b><p align="center">UPS Settings</p></b><br>
Only for devices with UPS support.

<li><b>Battery voltage</b> - battery voltage. 
<li><b>Power source</b> - power source (battery  or mains voltage) 
<li><b>Estimated battery time</b> - estimate operation time in case of switching to backup power. 
This value is relative, because it depends on the stability of the power consumed by the devices and the state of the batteries. 
<li><b>Delayed start</b> - delayed start function. This function operates as follows: 
when the battery is connecte, the switch remains in the sleep mode. This allows you to save the battery charge during the installation. 
Only when the mains voltage is supplied, the device starts up, immediately providing a redundant voltage for powering the video cameras. 
If this function is disabled, it takes some time to charge the battery after the power is supplied. In this time, the time of uninterruptible 
operation will be shorter. This function is enabled by default.
